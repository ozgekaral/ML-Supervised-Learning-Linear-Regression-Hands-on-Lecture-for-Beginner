However, hyperparameter values when set right can build highly accurate models, and thus we allow our models to try different combinations of hyperparameters during the training process and make predictions with the best combination of hyperparameter values. Some of the hyperparameters in Random Forest Classifier are n_estimators (total number of trees in a forest), max_depth (the depth of each tree in the forest), and criterion (the method to make splits in each tree). n_estimators set to 1 or 2 doesn’t make sense as a forest must have a higher number of trees, but how do we know what number of trees will yield the best results? And for this purpose, we try different values like [100, 200, 300]. The model will try all three of the given values and we can easily identify the optimal number of trees in our forest."
